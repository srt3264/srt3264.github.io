# About Me

Hello! My name is Suzanna Thompson & I'm a data scientist passionate about machine learning, meta-learning, continuous learning (+ optional active learning), interpretable models, neuro-inspired learning, and the oxford comma. I graduated with a master's in data science from Duke University and currently work as a data analyst at a fintech company.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, traveling, and working on passion projects. This website is a collection of my research, projects, and daily updates.
