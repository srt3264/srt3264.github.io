# Chapter 51: Sleep & Dreaming

Smith, J., & Doe, A. (2003). Sleep & dreaming. In Kandel, E. R., Schwartz, J. H., & Jessell, T. M. (Eds.), *Principles of neural science* (4th ed., pp. 1001-1021). McGraw-Hill.

## Key Points

- Sleep consists of alternating REM & non-REM periods. 
- We descirbe sleep quantitatively with three measures: 
    - brain activity is measured by EEG
    - eye movements are recorded by the electro-oculogram
    - muscle tone is measures by the electromyogram (EMG)

Based on the the measures mentioned above, sleep can be partitioned into five stages. 
- Stages 1 through 4 are non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. 
- Stage 5 is REM sleep

Stage 1: 
- transition between waking & sleep.
- sleep is incoming but not yet developed.
- EEG shows a decrease in high frequency activity

Stage 2: 
- first stage of sleep.
- marked on the EEG by the onset of spindle waves, 7 - 15 hz oscillations over a period of 1 - 2 seconds that resemble a spindle of thread, & k complexes
    - spindle waves and k-complexes reflect slow, synchronized oscillations of neuronal & synaptic activity within the thalamus & cerebral cortex.
    - this happens from the relazation & hyperpolarization of neurons & neuronal networks that come after gradual inactivation of the brain mechanisms of arousal.
- muscle tone decreases
- eyes slowly roll back and forth
- respiration becomes more regular and slows
- body temperature begins to decrease 

Stage 3: 
- can see on EEG by the appearance of a significant fraction of the delta wave oscilations (0.5 - 4 hz)
- these signal a further reduction in arousal processes in the brain & increased synchronization of cortical & thalamic activity. 
- respiration is slow & regular
- heart rate slows
- muscles relax
- temperature continues to descrease

Stage 4: 
- deepest state
- predominance of delta waves ( > 50% of the time in the EEG)
- slow respiration, heart rate
- muscles releax
- temperature decreases

Starting from waking to stage four takes about 30 minutes. 
After 30 minutes in stage four, we begin ascending backwards through the preceding stages. 
Then we enter REM (rapid eye movement) & more intense dreams begin.

REM: 
- complete loss of muscle tone from the inhibition of the spinal motor neurons by descending pathways 
- temperature regulaion is at a low point. 

We say that going back and forth between the stages is called damped oscilation (pictured below)

REM sleep takes up about 25% of the total sleep time.
