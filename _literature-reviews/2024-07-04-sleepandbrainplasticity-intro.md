# Key points

Our goal is to understand the sequences of events underlying the consolidation of memory traces..
- This implies the characterization of the time course & functional relationship between various processes in both waking and subsequent sleep:
    - Experience-dependent gene transcription 
    - Protein synthesis
    - Neuronal firing patterns
    - Synaptic function
